Time Complexity: The time required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called time complexity  of the algorithm.

Notation-
Best Case: Ω(g(n))
Average Case:(Θ)
Worst Case: O(N!)

Space Complexity: The amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called space complexity of the algorithm.
